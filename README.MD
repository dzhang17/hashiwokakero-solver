## 🎯 Overview

Hashiwokakero (橋をかけろ, "build bridges") is a logic puzzle where islands must be connected by bridges following specific rules:

* Each island shows the number of bridges that must connect to it
* Bridges run horizontally or vertically
* Bridges cannot cross each other
* At most two bridges can connect any pair of islands
* All islands must form a single connected network

This project provides two sophisticated solving approaches:

* **ILP Solver**: Exact method using Integer Linear Programming with lazy constraint generation
* **LNS Solver**: Metaheuristic approach with adaptive destruction operators and parallel repair strategies

## 🚀 Features

### Solvers

* **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**
  * Lazy constraint generation for improved efficiency
  * Advanced preprocessing techniques
  * Warm-start capabilities
  * Compatible with CBC, Gurobi, and other AMPL-supported solvers
* **Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)**
  * 7 adaptive destruction operators
  * Parallel repair strategies
  * Simulated annealing acceptance criterion
  * Solution caching and performance optimizations

### Visualization & Analysis

* Interactive puzzle visualization with solution display
* Side-by-side solver comparison
* Performance statistics and validation
* Comprehensive benchmarking suite
* Automated figure generation for research papers

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hashiwokakero_solver.git
cd hashiwokakero_solver
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install and activate AMPL (required for ILP solver):

   * If you have an AMPL license:
     ```bash
     python -m amplpy.modules activate [your-license-key]
     ```
   * For academic users, you can get a free license from [AMPL for Students](https://ampl.com/products/ampl/ampl-for-students/)
   * For evaluation, AMPL provides a size-limited demo version

   Note: The ILP solver requires AMPL to be properly activated. Without activation, you can still use the LNS solver.

## 🎮 Quick Start

### Visualizing and Solving Puzzles

The `visualize_solver.py` script provides an interactive way to solve and visualize puzzles:

```bash
# Basic usage - solves with ILP by default
python visualize_solver.py dataset/100/Hs_16_100_25_00_001.has

# Use LNS solver
python visualize_solver.py dataset/200/Hs_24_200_50_05_010.has --solver lns

# Compare both solvers
python visualize_solver.py dataset/400/Hs_34_400_75_15_020.has --solver both

# Set custom time limit and save images
python visualize_solver.py dataset/300/Hs_29_300_50_10_015.has --time-limit 600 --save
```

#### Command Line Options:

* `--solver {ilp|lns|both}`: Choose which solver to use (default: ilp)
* `--time-limit TIME`: Set time limit in seconds (default: 300)
* `--save`: Save visualizations as PNG files
* `--no-grid`: Hide grid lines in visualization

### Running Experiments

Generate comprehensive benchmark results and thesis figures:

```bash
python thesis_figures_generator.py
```

This will:

* Run both solvers on all 1,440 test instances
* Generate 8 publication-ready figures
* Create LaTeX tables for academic papers
* Save detailed results in CSV format

## 📊 Dataset Structure

The project includes 1,440 benchmark instances organized by size:

```
dataset/
├── 100/    # 360 puzzles with 100 islands
├── 200/    # 360 puzzles with 200 islands
├── 300/    # 360 puzzles with 300 islands
└── 400/    # 360 puzzles with 400 islands
```

Each file follows the naming convention: `Hs_[grid]_[islands]_[density]_[difficulty]_[id].has`

## 🔬 Research Results

Our extensive experiments on 1,440 instances show:

* **Small instances (100-200 islands)**: Both algorithms achieve >94% success rate with similar performance
* **Large instances (300-400 islands)**: LNS shows superior scalability with up to 37% faster solving times
* **Success vs Speed trade-off**: ILP maintains higher success rates (90.3% vs 86.1% on 400-island puzzles) while LNS offers better speed
